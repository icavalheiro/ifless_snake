# ifless_snake
A snake game done without IF statements

The rules are simple, we can use any libs and write any kind of code, but we are not allowed to use IF statements (nor terniary operators).

This is a simple game :D
To run it just open the index.html in any browser (you need internet access in order to load the 2 libs that I've used)
